Continuous advancements of technologies such as machine-to-machine interactions 
and big data analysis have led to the internet of things (IoT) making 
information sharing and smart decision-making possible using everyday devices. 
On the other hand, swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms seek to establish 
constructive interaction among agents regardless of their intelligence level. In 
SI algorithms, multiple individuals run simultaneously and possibly in a 
cooperative manner to address complex nonlinear problems. In this paper, the 
application of SI algorithms in IoT is investigated with a special focus on the 
internet of medical things (IoMT). The role of wearable devices in IoMT is 
briefly reviewed. Existing works on applications of SI in addressing IoMT 
problems are discussed. Possible problems include disease prediction, data 
encryption, missing values prediction, resource allocation, network routing, and 
hardware failure management. Finally, research perspectives and future trends 
are outlined.
