This article proposes a conceptual framework to guide research in neural 
computation by relating it to mathematical progress in other fields and to 
examples illustrative of biological networks. The goal is to provide insight 
into how biological networks, and possibly large artificial networks such as 
foundation models, transition from analog computation to an analog approximation 
of symbolic computation. From the mathematical perspective, I focus on the 
development of consistent symbolic representations and optimal policies for 
action selection within network settings. From the biological perspective, I 
give examples of human and animal social network behavior that may be described 
using these mathematical models.
