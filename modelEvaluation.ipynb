ML has recently enabled dynamic risk assessment by modeling time-series data, an upgrade from the static, \"snapshot\" assessment of patients that conventional statistical models and older ML algorithms offer. Regarding diagnosis, a deep learning model, a subset of ML, can accurately identify skin segments affected with chronic GVHD with satisfactory results. ML methods such as Q-learning and deep reinforcement learning have been utilized to develop adaptive treatment strategies (ATS) for the personalized prevention and treatment of acute and chronic GVHD.\\', \\'To capitalize on these promising advancements, there is a need for large-scale, multicenter collaborations to develop generalizable ML models. Furthermore, addressing pertinent issues such as the implementation of stringent ethical guidelines is crucial before the widespread introduction of AI into GVHD care.\\']', 'type': 'CASUAL'}\n",

The objective of this study was to establish a non-destructive monitoring system for estimating the fresh weight and leaf area of trellised crops.

The simple calculation was able to avoid overfitting with fewer limitations compared with the previous study. ConvNet was able to analyze raw images and evaluate the leaf area without additional sensors and features.

      "{'context': 'We examine a newly designed, interdisciplinary education program and clinical rotation for the first-year obstetrics and gynecology resident, implemented at the University of Colorado, Denver, Colorado, between the College of Nursing midwifery faculty and the School of Medicine Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. The barriers to program development, along with the advantages and disadvantages of collaboration between nursing and medical schools, are reviewed. The clinical experience, consisting of 5 clinical shifts, was designed using the conceptual model of collaborative intelligence. A formal rotation with the midwife was constructed for the first-year resident on the labor and delivery unit, providing care to intrapartum and postpartum women and families. The program included didactic and clinical teaching, with an emphasis on the normal physiologic process of birth and introduction to the midwifery scope of practice and philosophy of care. Formative evaluation of the clinical rotation demonstrated strong interest for continuation of the program and an ability to appreciate midwifery components of care in a limited exposure. Moreover, program development was successful without requiring large curricular changes for the resident. Future planning includes expansion of the program with increased emphasis on the postpartum and breastfeeding woman and continued program evaluation. The long-term success of such collaborations will depend on the continued support of the American College of Nurse-Midwives and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in developing and improving interdisciplinary educational teams. This article is part of a special series of articles that address midwifery innovations in clinical practice, education, interprofessional collaboration, health policy, and global health.', 'type': 'CASUAL'}\n",

We also observed a significant decline of a 10th of a SD in self-reported intellect with increasing birth-order position, and this effect persisted after controlling for objectively measured intelligence.

      "{'context': 'Hypertension is the leading cause of cardiovascular complications. This review focuses on the advancements in medical artificial intelligence (AI) models aimed at individualized treatment for hypertension, with particular emphasis on the approach to time-series big data on blood pressure and the development of interpretable medical AI models. The digitalization of daily blood pressure records and the downsizing of measurement devices enable the accumulation and utilization of time-series data. As mainstream blood pressure data shift from snapshots to time series, the clinical significance of blood pressure variability will be clarified. The time-series blood pressure prediction model demonstrated the capability to forecast blood pressure variabilities with a reasonable degree of accuracy for up to four weeks in advance. In recent years, various explainable AI techniques have been proposed for different purposes of model interpretation. It is essential to select the appropriate technique based on the clinical aspects; for example, actionable path-planning techniques can present individualized intervention plans to efficiently improve outcomes such as hypertension. Despite considerable progress in this field, challenges remain, such as the need for the prospective validation of AI-driven interventions and the development of comprehensive systems that integrate multiple AI methods. Future research should focus on addressing these challenges and refining the AI models to ensure their practical applicability in real-world clinical settings. Furthermore, the implementation of interdisciplinary collaborations among AI experts, clinicians, and healthcare providers are crucial to further optimizing and validate AI-driven solutions for hypertension management.', 'type': 'CASUAL'}\n",

      "{'context': 'The bean leaves can be affected by several diseases, such as angular leaf spots and bean rust, which can cause big damage to bean crops and decrease their productivity. Thus, treating these diseases in their early stages can improve the quality and quantity of the product. Recently, several robotic frameworks based on image processing and artificial intelligence have been used to treat these diseases in an automated way. However, incorrect diagnosis of the infected leaf can lead to the use of chemical treatments for normal leaf thereby the issue will not be solved, and the process may be costly and harmful. To overcome these issues, a modern deep learning framework in robot vision for the early detection of bean leaves diseases is proposed. The proposed framework is composed of two primary stages, which detect the bean leaves in the input images and diagnosing the diseases within the detected leaves. The U-Net architecture based on a pre-trained ResNet34 encoder is employed for detecting the bean leaves in the input images captured in uncontrolled environmental conditions. In the classification stage, the performance of five diverse deep learning models (e.g., Densenet121, ResNet34, ResNet50, VGG-16, and VGG-19) is assessed accurately to identify the healthiness of bean leaves. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using a challenging and extensive dataset composed of 1295 images of three different classes (e.g., Healthy, Angular Leaf Spot, and Bean Rust). In the binary classification task, the best performance is achieved using the Densenet121 model with a CAR of 98.31%, Sensitivity of 99.03%, Specificity of 96.82%, Precision of 98.45%, F1-Score of 98.74%, and AUC of 100%.

However, incorrect diagnosis of the infected leaf can lead to the use of chemical treatments for normal leaf thereby the issue will not be solved, and the process may be costly and harmful. To overcome these issues, a modern deep learning framework in robot vision for the early detection of bean leaves diseases is proposed. The proposed framework is composed of two primary stages, which detect the bean leaves in the input images and diagnosing the diseases within the detected leaves. The U-Net architecture based on a pre-trained ResNet34 encoder is employed for detecting the bean leaves in the input images captured in uncontrolled environmental conditions. In the classification stage, the performance of five diverse deep learning models (e.g., Densenet121, ResNet34, ResNet50, VGG-16, and VGG-19) is assessed accurately to identify the healthiness of bean leaves. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using a challenging and extensive dataset composed of 1295 images of three different classes (e.g., Healthy, Angular Leaf Spot, and Bean Rust). In the binary classification task, the best performance is achieved using the Densenet121 model with a CAR of 98.31%, Sensitivity of 99.03%, Specificity of 96.82%, Precision of 98.45%, F1-Score of 98.74%, and AUC of 100%. The higher CAR of 91.01% is obtained using the same model in the multi-classification task, with less than 2 s per image to produce the final decision.', 'type': 'FACTOID'}\n",

      "{'context': 'The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between fluid intelligence (gF) and the pattern of the functional characteristics in the resting state in adults using multivariate pattern analysis. Resting-state functional images from 100 participants in the Human Connectome Project data set were analyzed. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) was first calculated, and a support vector regression approach was used to identify the association with gF. To discover whether the connectivity of the gF-associated areas was also related to gF, we further checked the seed-based functional connectivity using the seeds from the ALFF.

Two radiologists manually labeled the skin, bone, muscle, abdominal visceral fat, subcutaneous fat, internal organs, and central nervous system in each CT slice and used these as references. For external validation, we collected 14 pediatric PET/CT scans from institution #2 (mean age, 9.1 years). The Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs), sensitivities, and precision were compared between the algorithms before and after transfer learning.

This study constitutes part of the user requirement definition of INCISIVE EU project. The project has been designed to explore the full potential of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies in cancer imaging to streamline diagnosis and management. The study aimed to map cancer care pathways (breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancers) across INCISIVE partner countries, and identify bottle necks within these pathways.', 'Email interviews were conducted with ten oncology specialised healthcare professionals representing INCISIVE partner countries: Greece, Cyprus, Spain, Italy, Finland, the United Kingdom (UK) and Serbia. A purposive sampling strategy was employed for recruitment and data was collected between December 2020 and April 2021. Data was entered into Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to allow content examination and comparative analysis.', 'The analysed pathways all shared a common characteristic: inequalities in relation to delays in cancer diagnosis and treatment. All the studied countries, except the UK, lacked official national data about diagnostic and therapeutic delays. Furthermore, a considerable variation was noted regarding the availability of imaging and diagnostic services across the seven countries. Several concerns were also noted for inefficiencies/inequalities with regards to national screening for the four investigated cancer types.', 'Delays in cancer diagnosis and treatment are an ongoing challenge and a source for inequalities. It is important to have systematic reporting of diagnostic and therapeutic delays in all countries to allow the proper estimation of its magnitude and support needed to address it. Our findings also support the orientation of the current policies towards early detection and wide scale adoption and implementation of cancer screening, through research, innovation, and technology. Technologies involving AI can have a great potential to revolutionise cancer care delivery.', 'This study highlights the widespread delay in cancer diagnosis across Europe and supports the need for, systematic reporting of delays, improved availability of imaging services, and optimised national screening programs.

The barriers to program development, along with the advantages and disadvantages of collaboration between nursing and medical schools, are reviewed. The clinical experience, consisting of 5 clinical shifts, was designed using the conceptual model of collaborative intelligence. A formal rotation with the midwife was constructed for the first-year resident on the labor and delivery unit, providing care to intrapartum and postpartum women and families. The program included didactic and clinical teaching, with an emphasis on the normal physiologic process of birth and introduction to the midwifery scope of practice and philosophy of care. Formative evaluation of the clinical rotation demonstrated strong interest for continuation of the program and an ability to appreciate midwifery components of care in a limited exposure. Moreover, program development was successful without requiring large curricular changes for the resident. Future planning includes expansion of the program with increased emphasis on the postpartum and breastfeeding woman and continued program evaluation.

Detection of cancer might be AI's most altruistic and convoluted challenge to date in the field of medicine. Embedding AI into various aspects of cancer diagnostics would be of immense use in dealing with the tedious, repetitive, time-consuming job of lesion detection, remove opportunities for human error, and cut costs and time. This would be of great value in cancer screening programs. By using AI algorithms, data from digital images from radiology and pathology that are imperceptible to the human eye can be identified (radiomics and pathomics). Correlating radiomics and pathomics with clinico-demographic-therapy-morbidity-mortality profiles will lead to a greater understanding of cancers. Specific imaging phenotypes have been found to be associated with specific gene-determined molecular pathways involved in cancer pathogenesis (radiogenomics).

This is because neural networks are typically trained on a specific dataset, and they learn to generalize from that dataset. However, they may not be able to generalize to new situations that are not similar to the ones they have been trained on.\\n\\nAnother key difference is that neural networks are typically not able to explain their reasoning, while humans can. For example, a neural network may be able to predict the weather, but it may not be able to explain why it made that prediction.

This article proposes a framework that exploits the concept of data reduction to decrease the amount of heterogeneous data in certain applications. A machine learning model that predicts a distortion rate and its corresponding reduction rate of the imputed data is also proposed, which uses the predicted values to select, among many reduction techniques, the most suitable approach. To support such a decision, the model also considers the context of the data producer that dictates the class of reduction algorithm that is allowed to be applied to the input stream. The achieved results indicate that the Huffman algorithm performed better considering the reduction of time-series data, with significant potential applications for smart city scenarios.',\n",

Correlating radiomics and pathomics with clinico-demographic-therapy-morbidity-mortality profiles will lead to a greater understanding of cancers. Specific imaging phenotypes have been found to be associated with specific gene-determined molecular pathways involved in cancer pathogenesis (radiogenomics). All these developments would not only help to personalize oncologic practice but also lead to the development of new imaging biomarkers. AI algorithms in oncoimaging and oncopathology will broadly have the following uses: cancer screening (detection of lesions), characterization and grading of tumors, and clinical decision-making and prognostication. However, AI cannot be a foolproof panacea nor can it supplant the role of humans. It can however be a powerful and useful complement to human insights and deeper understanding. Multiple issues like standardization, validity, ethics, privacy, finances, legal liability, training, accreditation, etc., need to be overcome before the vast potential of AI in diagnostic oncology can be fully harnessed.\",\n",

While DNNs can make accurate predictions, they may not provide meaningful explanations for their predictions. Human intelligence, on the other hand, is characterized by its ability to not only make predictions but also to explain and reason about them.\\n\\n- **Abstract vs. Metamer Tasks:** The context finds that humans perform better at abstract tasks than metamer tasks, whereas common neural network architectures typically perform worse on abstract tasks than matched metamers. This suggests that neural networks lack the ability to generalize to novel and abstract situations, which is a key aspect of human intelligence.\\n\\n- **Local vs. Global Neural Representations:** The context discusses the debate in network neuroscience regarding the role of local versus global neural representations in predicting general intelligence.
