      "{'context': \"Driven by recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision (CV), the implementation of AI systems in the medical domain increased correspondingly. This is especially true for the domain of medical imaging, in which the incorporation of AI aids several imaging-based tasks such as classification, segmentation, and registration. Moreover, AI reshapes medical research and contributes to the development of personalized clinical care. Consequently, alongside its extended implementation arises the need for an extensive understanding of AI systems and their inner workings, potentials, and limitations which the field of eXplainable AI (XAI) aims at. Because medical imaging is mainly associated with visual tasks, most explainability approaches incorporate saliency-based XAI methods. In contrast to that, in this article we would like to investigate the full potential of XAI methods in the field of medical imaging by specifically focusing on XAI techniques not relying on saliency, and providing diversified examples. We dedicate our investigation to a broad audience, but particularly healthcare professionals. Moreover, this work aims at establishing a common ground for cross-disciplinary understanding and exchange across disciplines between Deep Learning (DL) builders and healthcare professionals, which is why we aimed for a non-technical overview. Presented XAI methods are divided by a method's output representation into the following categories: Case-based explanations, textual explanations, and auxiliary explanations.\", 'type': 'CONFIRMATIONAL'}\n",

Whether that might ever be possible would depend on how we define intelligence, but what is indisputable is that new methods are needed to analyse and interpret the copious information provided by digital medical images, genomic databases, and biobanks. Technological advances have enabled applications of artificial intelligence (AI) including machine learning (ML) to be implemented into clinical practice, and their related scientific literature is exploding. Advocates argue enthusiastically that AI will transform many aspects of clinical cardiovascular medicine, while sceptics stress the importance of caution and the need for more evidence. This report summarizes the main opposing arguments that were presented in a debate at the 2021 Congress of the European Society of Cardiology. Artificial intelligence is an advanced analytical technique that should be considered when conventional statistical methods are insufficient, but testing a hypothesis or solving a clinical problem-not finding another application for AI-remains the most important objective. Artificial intelligence and ML methods should be transparent and interpretable, if they are to be approved by regulators and trusted to provide support for clinical decisions. Physicians need to understand AI methods and collaborate with engineers. Few applications have yet been shown to have a positive impact on clinical outcomes, so investment in research is essential.\", 'type': 'CONFIRMATIONAL'}\n",

      "{'context': \"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is one of the most common non-curable neurodegenerative diseases. Diagnosis is achieved clinically on the basis of different symptoms with considerable delays from the onset of neurodegenerative processes in the central nervous system. In this study, we investigated early and full-blown PD patients based on the analysis of their voice characteristics with the aid of the most commonly employed machine learning (ML) techniques. A custom dataset was made with hi-fi quality recordings of vocal tasks gathered from Italian healthy control subjects and PD patients, divided into early diagnosed, off-medication patients on the one hand, and mid-advanced patients treated with L-Dopa on the other. Following the current state-of-the-art, several ML pipelines were compared usingdifferent feature selection and classification algorithms, and deep learning was also explored with a custom CNN architecture. Results show how feature-based ML and deep learning achieve comparable results in terms of classification, with KNN, SVM and naÃ¯ve Bayes classifiers performing similarly, with a slight edge for KNN. Much more evident is the predominance of CFS as the best feature selector. The selected features act as relevant vocal biomarkers capable of differentiating healthy subjects, early untreated PD patients and mid-advanced L-Dopa treated patients.\", 'type': 'CASUAL'}\n",

      "{'context': \"The difficulty of explaining the outputs of artificial intelligence (AI) models and what has led to them is a notorious ethical problem wherever these technologies are applied, including in the medical domain, and one that has no obvious solution. This paper examines the proposal, made by Luciano Floridi and colleagues, to include a new 'principle of explicability' alongside the traditional four principles of bioethics that make up the theory of 'principlism'. It specifically responds to a recent set of criticisms that challenge the supposed need for such a principle to perform an enabling role in relation to the traditional four principles and therefore suggest that these four are sufficient without the addition of explicability. The paper challenges the critics' premise that explicability cannot be an ethical principle like the classic four because it is explicitly subordinate to them. It argues instead that principlism in its original formulation locates the justification for ethical principles in a midlevel position such that they mediate between the most general moral norms and the contextual requirements of medicine. This conception of an ethical principle then provides a mold for an approach to explicability on which it functions as an enabling principle that unifies technical/epistemic demands on AI and the requirements of high-level ethical theories.

      "{'context': 'Die in den letzten Jahren vorangetriebene standardisierte, strukturierte, radiologische Befundung (SSRB) verfolgt mehrere Ziele: Die Befunde sollen vollstÃ¤ndig, eindeutig, verstÃ¤ndlich und stringent sein; Wiederholungen oder Ã¼berflÃ¼ssige Inhalte sollen vermieden werden. DarÃ¼ber hinaus ergeben sich Vorteile bei der Darstellung zeitlicher VerlÃ¤ufe, Nachverfolgungen und Korrelationen mit strukturierten Befunden anderer Disziplinen sowie die Nutzung KI-basierter (kÃ¼nstliche Intelligenz) Methoden. Die Erstellung der vorliegenden Befundvorlage (â€žTemplateâ€œ) fÃ¼r die SSRB von nativen Computertomographien (CT) in der Harnsteindiagnostik folgte dem von der Deutschen RÃ¶ntgengesellschaft (DRG) vorgeschlagenen â€žProzess zur Erstellung qualitÃ¤tsgesicherter und konsensbasierter Befundvorlagen sowie anschlieÃŸender kontinuierlicher QualitÃ¤tskontrolle und Aktualisierungâ€œ mit mehreren Stufen von EntwÃ¼rfen, Konsensusmeetings und Weiterentwicklungen. Die finale Version wurde auf der Website der DRG (www.befundung.drg.de) verÃ¶ffentlicht. Das Template soll von der Steuerungsgruppe jÃ¤hrlich Ã¼berprÃ¼ft und ggf. angepasst werden. Die Befundvorlage beinhaltet 6\\xa0OrgandomÃ¤nen (z.\\u202fB. rechte Niere) fÃ¼r die Eingaben fÃ¼r insgesamt 21\\xa0verschiedene Items, die meistens mit Auswahlfenstern gemacht werden kÃ¶nnen. Wird fÃ¼r ein Organ bei der ersten Abfrage â€žkein Nachweis von Steinenâ€œ gewÃ¤hlt, springt die Abfrage automatisch zum nÃ¤chsten Organ, so dass die Bearbeitung trotz der potenziell hohen Gesamtzahl an Einzelabfragen zu allen Organen sehr zÃ¼gig zu bearbeiten ist. Die Etablierung einer standardisierten strukturierten Befundung von Schnittbildgebungsverfahren nicht nur der onkologischen Radiologie wird von den deutschen, europÃ¤ischen und nordamerikanischen radiologischen Gesellschaften als eine der aktuellen zentralen Aufgabe wahrgenommen. Mit der vorliegenden Befundvorlage zur Beschreibung von CT-Befunden zur Harnsteindiagnostik stellen wir die erste Version einer urologischen Vorlage Ã¼berhaupt vor. Weitere Templates fÃ¼r urologische Fragestellungen sollen folgen.', 'type': 'CASUAL'}\n",

      "{'context': 'The objective of the present study was to analyze the extent to which violent peer behavior and victimization, both traditional and cybernetic, and predict certain indicators of psychological maladjustment in adolescents, such as self-concept, satisfaction with life, feeling of loneliness, depressive symptomatology, perceived stress, social anxiety, empathy, and emotional intelligence. Participants in the study were 1318 adolescents of both sexes, aged between 11 and 18 years and enrolled in Compulsory Secondary Education schools. The design of the study was cross-sectional. The results indicated that the victims generally present greater maladjustment than the aggressors. Both victims and cybervictims showed a greater decrease in all the dimensions of self-concept, compared with aggressors and cyberaggressors. However, the two types of aggressors showed a higher likelihood of presenting low levels of empathy. Feeling of loneliness, depressive symptomatology, perceived stress, and degree of life satisfaction was more probable to be present in all groups of aggressors and victims. Finally, with regard to emotional intelligence, victims had a higher probability of obtaining low scores in all the dimensions of this construct; this was the case for traditional aggressors only in the dimension of emotion regulation.

       " {'context': 'To monitor groundwater salinization due to seawater intrusion (SWI) in the aquifer of the eastern Nile Delta, Egypt, we developed a predictive regression model based on an innovative approach using SWI indicators and artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies. Hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical data of the groundwater wells in three periods (1996, 2007, and 2018) were used as input data for the AI methods. All the studied indicators were enrolled in feature extraction process where the most significant inputs were determined, including the studied year, the distance from the shoreline, the aquifer type, and the hydraulic head. These inputs were used to build four basic AI models to get the optimal prediction results of the used indicators (the base exchange index (BEX), the groundwater quality index for seawater intrusion (GQISWI), and water quality). The machine learning models utilized in this study are logistic regression, Gaussian process regression, feedforward backpropagation neural networks (FFBPN), and deep learning-based long-short-term memory. The FFBPN model achieved higher evaluation results than other models in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and R[2] values in the testing phase, with R[2] values of 0.9667, 0.9316, and 0.9259 for BEX, GQISWI, and water quality, respectively. Accordingly, the FFBPN was used to build a predictive model for electrical conductivity for the years 2020 and 2030. Reasonable results were attained despite the imbalanced nature of the dataset for different times and sample sizes. The results show that the 1000 Î¼S/cm boundary is expected to move inland ~9.5 km (eastern part) to ~10 km (western part) to ~12.4 km (central part) between 2018 and 2030.

This paper examines the proposal, made by Luciano Floridi and colleagues, to include a new 'principle of explicability' alongside the traditional four principles of bioethics that make up the theory of 'principlism'. It specifically responds to a recent set of criticisms that challenge the supposed need for such a principle to perform an enabling role in relation to the traditional four principles and therefore suggest that these four are sufficient without the addition of explicability. The paper challenges the critics' premise that explicability cannot be an ethical principle like the classic four because it is explicitly subordinate to them. It argues instead that principlism in its original formulation locates the justification for ethical principles in a midlevel position such that they mediate between the most general moral norms and the contextual requirements of medicine. This conception of an ethical principle then provides a mold for an approach to explicability on which it functions as an enabling principle that unifies technical/epistemic demands on AI and the requirements of high-level ethical theories. The paper finishes by anticipating an objection that decision-making by clinicians and AI fall equally, but implausibly, under the principle of explicability's scope, which it rejects on the grounds that human decisions, unlike AI's, can be explained by their social environments.\",\n",

Participants in the study were 1318 adolescents of both sexes, aged between 11 and 18 years and enrolled in Compulsory Secondary Education schools. The design of the study was cross-sectional. The results indicated that the victims generally present greater maladjustment than the aggressors. Both victims and cybervictims showed a greater decrease in all the dimensions of self-concept, compared with aggressors and cyberaggressors. However, the two types of aggressors showed a higher likelihood of presenting low levels of empathy. Feeling of loneliness, depressive symptomatology, perceived stress, and degree of life satisfaction was more probable to be present in all groups of aggressors and victims. Finally, with regard to emotional intelligence, victims had a higher probability of obtaining low scores in all the dimensions of this construct; this was the case for traditional aggressors only in the dimension of emotion regulation.

       " {'context': 'To monitor groundwater salinization due to seawater intrusion (SWI) in the aquifer of the eastern Nile Delta, Egypt, we developed a predictive regression model based on an innovative approach using SWI indicators and artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies. Hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical data of the groundwater wells in three periods (1996, 2007, and 2018) were used as input data for the AI methods. All the studied indicators were enrolled in feature extraction process where the most significant inputs were determined, including the studied year, the distance from the shoreline, the aquifer type, and the hydraulic head. These inputs were used to build four basic AI models to get the optimal prediction results of the used indicators (the base exchange index (BEX), the groundwater quality index for seawater intrusion (GQISWI), and water quality). The machine learning models utilized in this study are logistic regression, Gaussian process regression, feedforward backpropagation neural networks (FFBPN), and deep learning-based long-short-term memory. The FFBPN model achieved higher evaluation results than other models in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and R[2] values in the testing phase, with R[2] values of 0.9667, 0.9316, and 0.9259 for BEX, GQISWI, and water quality, respectively. Accordingly, the FFBPN was used to build a predictive model for electrical conductivity for the years 2020 and 2030. Reasonable results were attained despite the imbalanced nature of the dataset for different times and sample sizes. The results show that the 1000 Î¼S/cm boundary is expected to move inland ~9.5 km (eastern part) to ~10 km (western part) to ~12.4 km (central part) between 2018 and 2030.

       " {'context': \"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad term referring to the application of computational algorithms that can analyze large data sets to classify, predict, or gain useful conclusions. Under the umbrella of AI is machine learning (ML). ML is the process of building or learning statistical models using previously observed real world data to predict outcomes, or categorize observations based on 'training' provided by humans. These predictions are then applied to future data, all the while folding in the new data into its perpetually improving and calibrated statistical model. The future of AI and ML in healthcare research is exciting and expansive. AI and ML are becoming cornerstones in the medical and healthcare-research domains and are integral in our continued processing and capitalization of robust patient EMR data. Considerations for the use and application of ML in healthcare settings include assessing the quality of data inputs and decision-making that serve as the foundations of the ML model, ensuring the end-product is interpretable, transparent, and ethical concerns are considered throughout the development process. The current and future applications of ML include improving the quality and quantity of data collected from EMRs to improve registry data, utilizing these robust datasets to improve and standardized research protocols and outcomes, clinical decision-making applications, natural language processing and improving the fundamentals of value-based care, to name only a few.\",\n",

This paper examines the proposal, made by Luciano Floridi and colleagues, to include a new 'principle of explicability' alongside the traditional four principles of bioethics that make up the theory of 'principlism'. It specifically responds to a recent set of criticisms that challenge the supposed need for such a principle to perform an enabling role in relation to the traditional four principles and therefore suggest that these four are sufficient without the addition of explicability. The paper challenges the critics' premise that explicability cannot be an ethical principle like the classic four because it is explicitly subordinate to them. It argues instead that principlism in its original formulation locates the justification for ethical principles in a midlevel position such that they mediate between the most general moral norms and the contextual requirements of medicine. This conception of an ethical principle then provides a mold for an approach to explicability on which it functions as an enabling principle that unifies technical/epistemic demands on AI and the requirements of high-level ethical theories. The paper finishes by anticipating an objection that decision-making by clinicians and AI fall equally, but implausibly, under the principle of explicability's scope, which it rejects on the grounds that human decisions, unlike AI's, can be explained by their social environments.\",\n",

Participants in the study were 1318 adolescents of both sexes, aged between 11 and 18 years and enrolled in Compulsory Secondary Education schools. The design of the study was cross-sectional. The results indicated that the victims generally present greater maladjustment than the aggressors. Both victims and cybervictims showed a greater decrease in all the dimensions of self-concept, compared with aggressors and cyberaggressors. However, the two types of aggressors showed a higher likelihood of presenting low levels of empathy. Feeling of loneliness, depressive symptomatology, perceived stress, and degree of life satisfaction was more probable to be present in all groups of aggressors and victims. Finally, with regard to emotional intelligence, victims had a higher probability of obtaining low scores in all the dimensions of this construct; this was the case for traditional aggressors only in the dimension of emotion regulation.

The vehicle dynamics model is established under multiconditional assumptions, the path planner and path tracking controller are designed based on the model predictive control algorithm, and the local desired path is reasonably planned in combination with the behavioral decision system. The behavioral decision algorithm based on finite state machine reasonably transforms the driving state according to the environmental changes, realizes the following of the target vehicle speed, and can take effective emergency braking in time when there is a collision danger. The system can complete the motion planning by the model predictive control algorithm and control the autonomous vehicle to smoothly track the replanned local desired path to complete the lane change overtaking action, which can meet the demand of ADAS. The path planner is designed based on the MPC algorithm, solving the objective function with obstacle avoidance function, planning the optimal path that can avoid a collision, and using 5th order polynomial to fit the output local desired path points. In 5âˆ¼8 s time, the target vehicle decelerates to 48 km/h; the autonomous vehicle immediately makes a deceleration action and gradually reduces the speed difference between the two vehicles until it reaches the target speed, at which time the distance between the two vehicles is close to the safe distance, obtained by the simulation test results.
